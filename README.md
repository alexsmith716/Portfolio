# Portfolio

## My Portfolio

This is my Portfolio project. The goal of this repo is to become familiar working with Next.js. I want to use Next.js as a platform to build out TypeScript, UI, API, AWS, CI/CD, Testing and basically all other Server/Client skills & technologies. Main focus right now is to get a stable project that I can improve my Testing, TS and React knowledge.

[The app is deployed here.](https://portfolio-alexsmith716-outlookcom.vercel.app)

## Technologies Used:
* Next.JS 12.1.6
* TypeScript
* React 18
* Redux
* Redux Persist
* Next Redux Wrapper

* AWS SDK
* Styled Components

## Next.JS Features:
- Custom `App` Component
